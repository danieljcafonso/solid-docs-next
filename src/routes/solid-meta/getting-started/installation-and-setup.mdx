## Installing

To get started with Solid Meta, install it using your preferred package manager.

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="npm">
```bash frame="none"
npm i @solidjs/meta
```
</div>

<div id="yarn">
```bash frame="none"
yarn add @solidjs/meta
```
</div>

<div id="pnpm">
```bash frame="none"
pnpm add @solidjs/meta
```
</div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

## How it works

1.  You wrap your App with `<MetaProvider />`
2.  To insert head tags within your app, just render one of `<Title />`, `<Meta />`, `<Style />`, `<Link />`, and `<Base />` components as often as needed.
3.  One the server if you render the `<head>` element using SolidJS in JSX you are all good. Otherwise use `getAssets` from `solid-js/web` to insert the assets where you want.

On the server, the tags are collected, and then on the client the server-generated tags are removed in favor of the client-rendered tags so that SPAs still work as expected (e.g. in cases where subsequent page loads need to change the head tags).
