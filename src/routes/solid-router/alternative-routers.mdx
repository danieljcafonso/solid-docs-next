## Hash Mode Router

By default, Solid Router uses `location.pathname` as route path. You can simply switch to hash mode through the `source` property on `<Router>` component.

```jsx
import { HashRouter } from "@solidjs/router";

<HashRouter />;
```

## Memory Mode Router

You can also use memory mode router for testing purpose.

```jsx
import { MemoryRouter } from "@solidjs/router";

<MemoryRouter />;
```
