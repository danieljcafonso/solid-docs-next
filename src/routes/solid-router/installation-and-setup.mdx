A router provides a way to change a user's view based on the URL in the browser.
This allows a "single-page" application to simulate a traditional multipage site.
To use Solid Router, components called Routes that depend on the value of the URL (the "path") are specified, and the router handles the mechanism of swapping them in and out.

Solid Router is the universal router for SolidJS - it works for rendering on the client or on the server.
It was inspired by and combines paradigms of React Router and the Ember Router.
Routes can be defined directly in an app's template using JSX, but can also be passed to a route configuration directly as an object.
It also supports nested routing, so navigation can change a part of a component, rather than completely replacing it.

It supports all of Solid's SSR methods and has Solid's transitions baked in, so use it freely with suspense, resources, and lazy components.
Solid Router provides a way to define a load function that loads parallel to the routes ([render-as-you-fetch](https://epicreact.dev/render-as-you-fetch/)).

## Install

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="npm">
```bash frame="none"
npm i @solidjs/router
```
</div>

<div id="pnpm">
```bash frame="none"
pnpm add @solidjs/router
```

## Add the Router

Install `@solidjs/router`, then start the application by rendering the router component

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";

render(() => <Router />, document.getElementById("app"));
```
