title: createAsync
---

This is light wrapper over [`createResource`](/reference/create-resource) that aims to serve as stand-in for a future primitive we intend to bring to Solid core in 2.0. It is a simpler async primitive where the function tracks like `createMemo` and it expects a promise back that it turns into a Signal. Reading it before it is ready causes Suspense/Transitions to trigger.

```jsx
const user = createAsync(() => getUser(params.id));
```

<Callout>
	Using `cache` in `createResource` directly won't work properly as the fetcher
	is not reactive and it won't invalidate properly.
</Callout>
