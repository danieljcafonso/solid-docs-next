Actions are data mutations that can trigger invalidations and further routing.
A list of prebuilt response helpers can be found below.

```jsx
import { action, revalidate, redirect } from "@solidjs/router"

// anywhere
const myAction = action(async (data) => {
  await doMutation(data);
  throw redirect("/", { revalidate: getUser.keyFor(data.id) }); // throw a response to do a redirect
});

// in component
<form action={myAction} method="post" />

//or
<button type="submit" formaction={myAction}></button>
```

Actions only work with **post** requests.
This means forms require `method="post"`.

A `with` method can be used when typed data is required.
This removes the need to use `FormData` or other additional hidden fields.
The `with` method works similar to `bind`, which applies the arguments in order.

Without `with`:

```js
const deleteTodo = action(async (formData: FormData) => {
  const id = Number(formData.get("id"))
  await api.deleteTodo(id)
})

<form action={deleteTodo} method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="id" value={todo.id} />
  <button type="submit">Delete</button>
</form>
```

Using `with`:

```js
const deleteUser = action(api.deleteTodo)

<form action={deleteTodo.with(todo.id)} method="post">
  <button type="submit">Delete</button>
</form>
```

### Notes of `<form>` implementation and SSR

This requires stable references because a string can only serialize as an attribute, and across SSR they would need to match.
The solution is to provide a unique name.

```jsx
const myAction = action(async (args) => {}, "my-action");
```

## `useAction`

Instead of forms, actions can directly be wrapped in a `useAction` primitive.
This is how router context is created.

```jsx
// in component
const submit = useAction(myAction);
submit(...args);
```

The outside of a form context can use custom data instead of `formData`.
These helpers preserve types.

However, even when used with server functions, such as with SolidStart, this requires client side javascript and is not Progressive Enhancible like forms are.

## `useSubmission`/`useSubmissions`

Are used to injecting the optimistic updates while actions are in flight.
They either return a single Submission(latest) or all that match with an optional filter function.

```jsx
type Submission<T, U> = {
  input: T;
  result: U;
  error: any;
  pending: boolean
  clear: () => {}
  retry: () => {}
}

const submissions = useSubmissions(action, (input) => filter(input));
const submission = useSubmission(action, (input) => filter(input));
```
